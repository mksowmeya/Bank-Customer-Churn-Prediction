# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The objective of our project is to apply Spark to solve a business problem by developing a predictive model for bank customer churn. We aim to use a dataset containing information about bank customers to identify factors contributing to churn and build a predictive model that classifies customers as potential churners or not.
